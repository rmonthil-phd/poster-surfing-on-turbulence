# Scientific Presentation's Poster: "Surfing on turbulence"

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A poster presenting the study of "surfing" on turbulence in the context of plankton migration.
The whole poster is contained in the [surfing_on_turbulence.svg](./surfing_on_turbulence.svg) file alone.
This document is shared so that it can be used as an example of scientific poster and a template to build upon.

## Background

This document has been produced during my PhD thesis and as part of the [C0PEP0D](https://c0pep0d.github.io/) project.
This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 834238).
Results presented in this document are obtained using the [SHELD0N](https://github.com/C0PEP0D/sheld0n) code and the [Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/).

## Install

### Dependencies

The file has been produced using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/fr/) an amazing free vectorial drawing tool. 
You will most certainly need the [TexText](https://textext.github.io/textext/) to be able to edit latex blocks.

Any other vector drawing tool should be able to open and edit the file though.

### Installing

Clone this repository or just download the [surfing_on_turbulence.svg](./surfing_on_turbulence.svg) file.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/C0PEP0D/sheld0n.git
```

### Known issue

The poster is pretty heavy. Be sure to have enough memory before opening the file.
