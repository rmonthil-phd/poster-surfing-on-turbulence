[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A poster presentating my PhD work on "Surfing on turbulence".
The whole poster is contained the sole [surfing_on_turbulence.svg](./surfing_on_turbulence.svg) file.

## Background

This software has been produced during my PhD thesis and as part as the European Research Council project: [C0PEP0D](https://c0pep0d.github.io/)
Results presented here are obtained using the [SHELD0N](https://github.com/C0PEP0D/sheld0n) code and the [Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/).

## Install

### Dependencies

The file has been produced using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/fr/) an amazing free vectorial drawing tool. 
You will most certainly need the [TexText](https://textext.github.io/textext/) to be able to edit latex blocks.

Any other vectorial drawing tool should be able to open and edtit the file though.

### Installing

Clone this repository or just download the [surfing_on_turbulence.svg](./surfing_on_turbulence.svg) file.

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/C0PEP0D/sheld0n.git
```

### Known issue

The poster is pretty heavy. Be sure to have enough memory before opening the file.
